solutions and for some problems some of the working/thought processes involved working through the questions contained within Real World Haskell by Bryan O'Sullivan.

Most of the problems aren't too taxing and I highly recommend doing them - they're fun and a great way to learn.

Chapter 1 and 2 aren't included in here. Not much there really...
